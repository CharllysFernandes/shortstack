# Let's Bundle and still use ES modules!

## Browsersync
Browsersync is magic, let's serve our dev env with it so we get all it's goodies, but ignore css/js that isn't a bundle, because we have plans for those.

## Javascript
Rollup is minimal (I like minimal) and fast as ⚡️, let's use it to bundle our ES modules (currently recommended strategy) and also easily import packages from NPM.

## CSS
PostCSS is going to let us import NPM modules too, as well as let us write CSS that matches future specs. 

With all of that, you're rocking and rolling with a small footprint set of tools that will help you keep your bundles small for modern app delivery.
