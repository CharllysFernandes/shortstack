3 [concurrent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) tasks providing shaken bundles & enabling modern syntax. 

## Browsersync
[Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) serves the dev env so we get all the goodies: live reload, cross device syncing, debugging, etc.

## Javascript
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) is minimal and fast. Let's use it to bundle and treeshake our ES modules, import packages from NPM, and import CSS. 

## CSS
[PostCSS](https://postcss.org) is going to let us import NPM modules to our CSS graph, with an added bonus of a [postcss-preset-env](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/) enabling future CSS features today. 

# Getting Started
1. Install dependencies `npm i`
2. Spin it up `npm start`
